HW06 â€” WORCHBOUND 1 (deadline: 2015-10-29)
===

Write a basic "clone" of Gunbound/Scorch/Worms.

* 2-player turn-based game.
* No movement yet.
* Each player take turns shooting an artillery round in an attempt to hit the other player.
* The active player sets an angle and power to shoot the round.
* Wind effects is present and changes per turn at random.
* The rounds follow the projectile motion.
* Model each player as a rectangle.
* Model the artillery rounds as circles (get it? hahah).
